This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. The webapp can predict following Diseases:
* Diabetes
* Heart Disease
* Kidney Disease
* Liver Disease

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction
